## Overview: 
This project compares the deflection shapes and stress distributions of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load using two theories:
1. Theory of Elastica: Accounts for large deflections and nonlinear effects.
2. Euler-Bernoulli Beam Theory: Assumes small deflections and linear elasticity.

## Objectives:
1. Compare deflection shapes and stress distributions predicted by both theories.
2. Analyze how the assumptions of each theory influence the results.
